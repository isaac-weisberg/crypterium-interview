# Crypterium Technical Interview

It was alright. There were a couple of questions during the interview itself.

And then - this view model (spoiler: 2 of them) and a view. 

The dude has told that I am ought to find some issues with the architecture in this stack of objects. Specifically - the architecture. Alright.

I have left my comments in the code, you will find them embedded with `// CC:` EOL comment mnemonic.

These comments do cover everything that I have found of interest attempting to solve the task.

Then, I converted my comments into an email. Unfortunately, it's in Russian because it was contextually more appropriate.

But, pretty much my email is just 1 to 1 listing of those comments, ordered by importance descending.

They also sent a reply, with feedback on my response. It was also in Russian.

## My impressions of their response

I think it was alright... There are some pieces that make me wonder if we're on the same page. But yeah, I guess it was fun.
